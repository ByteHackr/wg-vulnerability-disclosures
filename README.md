# **Vulnerability Disclosures**

The OpenSSF Vulnerability Disclosures Working Group seeks to help improve the overall security of the open source software ecosystem by helping mature and advocate well-managed vulnerability reporting and communication. 

## **Objective**

The OpenSSF Vulnerability Disclosures Working Group seeks to help improve the overall security of the open source software ecosystem by helping develop and advocate well-managed vulnerability reporting and communication.  We plan on addressing this challenge through the following actions:

- Documenting and promoting reasonable vulnerability disclosure and coordination practices within the OSS ecosystem for component maintainers and community members by providing documented standards and educational materials.

- Identifying vulnerability disclosure pain points for OSS maintainer, consumers, and security researchers and take steps to address them.

- Facilitate the development and adoption of a standards-based OSS Vulnerability Exchange that uses existing industry formats and allows OSS projects of all sizes to be able to report, share, and learn about vulnerabilities within OSS components.

## **Current work**

- [Guide to coordinated vulnerability disclosure for open source software projects](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide) to assist projects in handling vulnerabilities.
- [Open Source Vulnerability Schema](https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema) - see also [osv.dev](https://osv.dev).
- [OpenSSF Recommendations for Open Source Software Vulnerability Disclosure Whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ggvl7_p7-tmieP5He1dSmRbndDz1CG2_BqNpk6ss6ks/edit) (incubating) - a draft longer paper on various related topics
- [Unified list of metadata for vulnerability reports and disclosures](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eZpBk2aIup29KcWwN5MAhvkk60EE_DRt2YRtLo8P0zs/edit?usp=sharing)
