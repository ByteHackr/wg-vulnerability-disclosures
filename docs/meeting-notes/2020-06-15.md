# Agenda & notes

- [Let’s turn the vulnerability metadata into a format specification](https://github.com/Open-Source-Security-Coalition/Vulnerability-Disclosures-/issues/8)
  - Seems like a good idea for adoption
  - Needs to be verified by GitHub and HackerOne if it suits the needs of product teams
  - Could potentially reach to other Coalition members to see if the format could be useful
  - Short term: this could be published in a public-facing repo in the Coalition org
- [WG leadership transition](https://github.com/Open-Source-Security-Coalition/Vulnerability-Disclosures-/issues/9)
  - Alex wants to rotate off
  - Marcin wants to stay
  - We’ll need another pilot / co-pilot
  - We’ll get back to it in the leads meeting on Thursday
    - May reach out to other Coalition members

# Homework

- Homework: create a GitHub issue to do research on popular data formats
  - Should include how to structure a specification
- Homework: try to express metadata master list from the spreadsheet in the selected data format
